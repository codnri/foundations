    "# Initial Data Exploration and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of any data analysis or predictive modeling task is an initial exploration of the data. Even if you collected the data yourself and you already have a list of questions in mind that you want to answer, it is important to explore the data before doing any serious analysis, since oddities in the data can cause bugs and muddle your results. Before exploring deeper questions, you have to answer many simpler ones about the form and quality of data. That said, it is important to go into your initial data exploration with a big picture question in mind since the goal of your analysis should inform how you prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to raise some of the questions you should consider when you look at a new data set for the first time and show how to perform various Python operations related to those questions. We are going to cover a lot of ground in this notebook, touching briefly on many topics from data cleaning to graphing to feature engineering. We will cover many of these topics in future notebooks in greater detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the [Titanic disaster training set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) available from [Kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com/), a website dedicated to data science competitions and education. You need to create a Kaggle account and accept the rules for the Titanic competition to download the data set. The data set consists of 891 passengers who rode aboard the Titanic."

We could extract last names to try to group family members together, but even then the number of categories would be very large. In addition, the `Parch` and `SibSp` variables already contain some information about family relationships, so from the perspective of predictive modeling, the Name variable could be removed. On the other hand, it can be nice to have some way to uniquely identify particular cases and names are interesting from a personal and historical perspective, so let's keep `Name`, knowing that we won't actually use it in any predictive models we make.\n",

Creating plots is one of the quickest ways to detect outliers. For instance, the histogram above shows that 1 or 2 passengers were near age 80. Ages near 80 are uncommon for this data set, but in looking at the general shape of the data seeing one or two 80 year olds doesn't seem particularly surprising.\n",

The dotted lines with bars on the ends are \"whiskers\" which encompass the great majority of the data and points beyond the whiskers indicate uncommon values.

Indeed, it looks like one passenger paid almost twice as much as any other passenger. Even the passengers that paid between 200 and 300 are far higher than the vast majority of the other passengers.\n",
